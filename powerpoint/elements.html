		<h1> My Mission</h1>
		<p><q>‘A lot has been written about me by other people. Now I will share with you the story of my life in my own words.’</q></p><br>
       <p>Swami Ramdev is a household name in India. But do you know where he was born? Why did he take sanyas and get into spirituality? What is his <span>vision</span> for India?</p>
       <p>Fearless, driven and with a penchant for being outspoken, Swami Ramdev-for the first time-addresses the major controversies, turning points and achievements of his life. An autobiographical account, the book is written with senior journalist Uday Mahurkar and captures the seer’s journey from a small village in Haryana to the international stage. As we uncover the trials, tribulations and triumphs of his life, we realize that there is more to the ascetic than often meets the eye. The book provides insights into his childhood, his passion for yoga and good health, his friends and foes, and the Swadeshi campaign he has spearheaded. In 2006, the globally popular yoga teacher known for his work in Ayurveda, health and social issues founded the Patanjali Group of Institutions that is now a major FMCG company with a turnover of about Rs 12,000 crore.</p>
       <p>Engaging, revealing and inspiring, the book shows how determination, passion and tenacity can transform the ordinary into the extraordinary</p>
